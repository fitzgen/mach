A Rust interface to the **user-space** API of the Mach 3.0 kernel exposed in
`/usr/include/mach` and that underlies macOS.

This library does not expose the **kernel-space** API of the Mach 3.0 kernel
exposed in
`SDK/System/Library/Frameworks/Kernel.framework/Versions/A/Headers/mach`. 

That is, if you are writing a kernel-resident device drivers or some other
kernel extensions you have to use something else. The user-space kernel API is
often API-incompatible with the kernel space one, and even in the cases where
they match, they are sometimes ABI incompatible such that using this library
would have **undefined behavior**.

# Platform support

The following table describes the current CI set-up:
